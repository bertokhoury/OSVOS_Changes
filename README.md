We utlized scaelles' [TensorFlow based model for our project](https://github.com/scaelles/OSVOS-TensorFlow).


1. From scaelles, follow steps one through three under installation.

2. Continuing, follow steps one and two under Demo Online Training and Testing.

3. Follow steps one through four on Training the Parent Network. This will be required to ensure that you can create your own unique parent directory.
